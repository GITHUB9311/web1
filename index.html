<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" title="www specification">The World Wide Web (WWW)</a> which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser and are published by a software application called a web server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-existed the Web in some form by over two decades and upon whose technologies the Web is built.
HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. <br>Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</p>
